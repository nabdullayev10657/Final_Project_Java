# Final_Project_Java
This is the project that visualises the Plane Crashes between 1937 and 2009. Here as a team, we have added some functionalities for user. User can search, sort, list, filter the records in a way that he or she wants. We hope this project will be beneficial for those who want to work with projects and file manipulation operations.
